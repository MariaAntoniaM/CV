      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <p>I have multiple hobbies, for example, I’ve been playing the piano ever since I was 4 years old. I really love the way it makes me feel, and what the music transmits.</p>

      <p>
        I have also loved drawing ever since I was young. I principally work with pencils, colors, and watercolors.
        I also love writing. I’ve never been good at poetry, but I feel when I’m writing stories all my creativity flows and allows me to place in the paper my emotions and imagination.

      <h1>Dreams</h1>
      <p>
        To be honest, I still haven’t decided exactly what I wish to study once I graduate from school. Although I clearly know I do not wish to study medicine nor law, I have considered studying chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and python.
        <p>
          I have always had this sort of dream of after graduating, going to live abroad for my university studies with my friends in Canada or maybe even England. One of my biggest aspirations has always been traveling and meeting the whole world. I am especially excited to travel to France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and England. I will also love to meet Japan and Korea!

      <h1>Pets</h1>

      <p>
      I have a French Puddle mini toy, her name is Canela because when we first met her fur color was kind of cinnamon color, but as she grew older, her fur color started getting whiter and whiter, and now she is not cinnamon at all!</p>

<p>I really love her a lot. I think she is extremely cute and funny! She is sort of short tempered, and always wants to play!</p>

<p>Recently we bought her shoes (since she is now sleeping at my parent’s room and her claws made to much noise at night) This is a picture of her! </p>

 <h1>Story Time!</h1>
 <p>
   Im gonna tell the time when I accidentality damaged my phone! It all started when I broke my phone’s screen. I was fidgeting with my phone case and accidentally took it off, then it fell to the ground and the screen broke! (Its an important detail for later) The story continues when I was in the car with my best friends on our way to a house in the countryside for my friend's birthday. I had my phone on my lap, and my friends had the amazing idea that every time we did a curve, we will throw into the friends on that side. Then things got a little out of hand and we were all staked on tope of each other, what I came to know after is that my phone was under it all! And the pleasure convinced with the cracks damaged the display!
